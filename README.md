# kselect

## Overview

This module implements an algorithm for determiming a near optimal K for use with the K-Means clustering algorithm. It applies the welknow Elbow Method along with the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC)

## Installation

## Demo

## Experiments

Because the BIC is based on cluster density, there is a some variation in the value selected for K depending on the total number of data points. Several expereminents were performed using artificial clusters arranged in square grid with data points randomly generated in each square of the grid. A sufficient margin was imposed between the squares so the clusters are easily visible to the human eye.
